Even so, he struggles against fate itself to defeat the God hand and stop their vile evil from spreading. He wields a giant sword called the Dragonslayer "It was too big to be called a sword. Massive, thick, heavy, and far too rough. Indeed, it was a heap of raw iron."</FONT>

	<FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#fa0300">Skull Knight is an old warrior who wages battle against the Godhand. He is over 1000 years old and is incredibly realistic in his world views, acting very nihilistic at times too, and believes in causality and how everyone must follow their own fate. Despite this, he actively encourages Guts to struggle against his fate so that he may gain his revenge. He wields the Sword of Actuation, a weapon coated in molten behelits that can cut open time and space.</FONT>
