	<FONT SIZE="5" COLOR="#fa0300">The berserker armour is a cursed set of heavy iron that protects the wearer from extreme damage. It increases your pain tolerance by a huge amount, not making it unnoticeable but ignorable. It also closes wounds and mends bones during fighting by forcefully holding them together with spikes. The armour is incredibly powerful but it can and will kill the wearer. It is currently worn by Guts.</FONT>
